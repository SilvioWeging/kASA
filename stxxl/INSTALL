QUICK INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS FOR POSIX COMPATIBLE SYSTEMS

* Extract the tarball and change into the stxxl root directory.

* Create a separate build directory (in-source building is prohibited):
  - mkdir build
  - cd build

* Run cmake to detect the build platform (where ".." is the STXXL tree):
  - cmake ..

* Check cmake's output for errors, then run build the library:
  - make

* See http://stxxl.sourceforge.net/ for more details.
