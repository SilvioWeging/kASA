This directory contains some benchmarks referenced in past papers on
STXXL. These mostly compare to versions of TPIE, LEDA-SM and BerkeleyDB.

The code works only with old versions of TPIE: 091905 (which is the youngest
version at duke.edu). To enable compilation with TPIE, download
tpie_091905.tgz, unpack and compile it in the tools/benchmarks directory of the
source tree. The cmake file will detect
tools/benchmarks/tpie_*/lib/libtpie.a and compile the TPIE tests with it.

LEDA-SM test were removed as the library is no longer available.

Comparisons against BerkeleyDB are easier, because this library has a very
stable interface. If TPIE was detected, the cmake script will search for
BerkeleyDB on the system and attempt to compile with it.

All benchmarks not depending on external libraries are build with
-DBUILD_TESTS=ON.
